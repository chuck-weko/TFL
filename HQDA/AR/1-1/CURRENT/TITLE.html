<h2> History.</h2>
<p> This publication is a major revision.</p>
<h2> Summary.</h2>
<p> This regulation prescribes policy and responsibilities for the Army planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process, designed to help the Army acquire, allocate, and manage resources for military functions. This regulation outlines the organizational framework within which the process operates and describes its functional phases.
The regulation implements guidance in <a href="../../../../DOD/DODD/GOTO.html">DODD 7045.14</a> and other Department of Defense issuances.</p>
<h2> Applicability.</h2>
<p> This regulation applies to the Regular Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the U.S. Army Reserve, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2> Proponent and exception authority.</h2>
<p> The proponent of this regulation is the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller). The proponent has the authority to approve exceptions or waivers to this regulation that are consistent with controlling law and regulations.  The proponent may delegate this approval authority, in writing, to a division chief within the proponent agency or its direct reporting unit or field operating agency, in the grade of colonel or the civilian equivalent.  Activities may request a waiver to this regulation by providing justification that includes a full analysis of the expected benefits and must include formal review by the activity’s senior legal officer.  All waiver requests will be endorsed by the commander or senior leader of the requesting activity and forwarded through their higher headquarters to the policy proponent. Refer to <a href="../../25-30/CURRENT/TITLE.html">AR 25–30</a> for specific guidance.</p>
<h2> Army internal control process.</h2>
<p> This regulation contains internal control provisions in accordance with <a href="../../11-2/CURRENT/TITLE.html">AR 11–2</a> and identifies key internal controls that must be evaluated (see <a href="APNX B.html">appendix B</a>).</p>
<h2> Supplementation.</h2>
<p> Supplementation of this regulation and establishment of command and local forms are prohibited without prior approval of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) (SAFM–BUC–F), Washington, DC 20310–0700.</p>
<h2> Suggested improvements.</h2>
<p> Users are invited to send comments or suggested improvements on <a href="../../../FORMS/GOTO.html">DA Form 2028</a> (Recommended Changes to Publications and Blank Forms) directly to Headquarters, Department of the Army, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Budget)/Director of the Army Budget, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) (SAFM–BUC–F), Washington, DC 20310–0700.</p>
<h2> Committee management.</h2>
<p> <a href="../../15-39/CURRENT/TITLE.html">AR 15–39</a> requires the proponent to justify establishing / continuing committee(s), coordinate draft publications, and coordinate changes in committee status with the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, Analysis and Integration Cell (AAAI–CL), 105 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310–0105. Further, if it is determined that an established "group" identified within this regulation, later takes on the characteristics of a committee, as found in the <a href="../../15-39/CURRENT/TITLE.html">AR 15–39</a>, then the proponent will follow all <a href="../../15-39/CURRENT/TITLE.html">AR 15–39</a> requirements for establishing and continuing the group as a committee.</p>
<h2> Distribution.</h2>
<p> This publication is available in electronic media only and is intended for command levels C, D, and E for the Regular Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the U.S. Army Reserve.</p>
