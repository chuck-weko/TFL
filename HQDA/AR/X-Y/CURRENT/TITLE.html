<title>Army Regulation Oops Page</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>You should never reach this page</h1>
<p> The reason you are here is because when I create links in a PDF to an Army Regulation, I use a generic URL that I edit to match the desired URL.</p>
<p> You reached this page because the generic link didn't get updated.</p>
